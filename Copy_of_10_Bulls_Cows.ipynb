        "In this assignment you will program a version of an old game called Bulls and Cows.  It is somewhat similar to Wordle, but with numbers instead of words (and various other differences . . . read carefully!).\n",
        "\n",
        "The game is played like this:  \n",
        "1. The computer will choose a secret code that the player is trying to guess.\n",
        "2. The secret code will be 4 digits long.  It will use only the digits 1-6, and it will have no repeated digits.  For example the secret code might be 1326 or 6241 but it cannot be 2652 or 4913 or 2601.\n",
        "3. The computer will prompt the user for a guess, and the user will guess.  The guess must follow the same rules (4 digits long, only use digits 1-6, no repeats).  The program should not allow an invalid guess.\n",
        "4. After each guess, the computer will give feedback to the user as follows:  \n",
        "(i) Each digit of the guess that is in the secret code and in the correct position is called a Bull (B).  \n",
        "(ii) Each digit of the guess that exists somewhere in the secret code, but *not* in the same position as in the guess, is called a Cow (C).  \n",
        "(iii) A digit of the guess that doesn't occur anywhere in the secret code is called a miss (X).  \n",
        "The computer will inform the user how many Bulls, how many Cows, and how many misses the user's guess had.  \n",
        "The feedback will always start with B's, then list C's, then list X's.  \n",
        "For example if the secret code is 1326  \n",
        "and the guess is 4316  \n",
        "then the computer should respond with \"BBCX\"  \n",
        "because there are two Bulls (the 3 and the 6 are Bulls, because they occur in the same position in the guess as in the secret code),  \n",
        "one Cow (the 1, which is a correct digit but in the wrong position),  \n",
        "and one Miss (the 4, which does not occur anywhere in the secret code).  \n",
        "> **Important:** the feedback string should always list the Bulls first, then the Cows, then the Misses.  It should **not** tell the user which digits are which!  The only information in the feedback string is how many of each there are.  In the example above, for instance, the feedback is **not** \"XBCB\" but rather \"BBCX\".  This is different from Wordle, if you are familiar with that game.\n",
        "5. The user should then be prompted for another guess.  This guess-with-feedback process should be repeated until the user gets the correct code, at which point the computer should indicate that they have won the game.  However, the user should only be allowed 6 guesses; if they don't guess correctly in 6 attempts, then following the feedback from their final guess they should get a message that they have lost the game, and the secret code should be revealed.\n",
