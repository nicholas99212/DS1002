        "1. The US Census gathered data on race based on self-identification, using check boxes and allowing multiple races to be selected by an individual person.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. We gather these data to observe trends and create statistics based on other factors that are associated with race. These data are used extensively in politics and society to provide an explanation for the current state of our country and to argue in favor of different policies. Data quality matters because it's impossible to make accurate inferences if the data is not clean.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. I believe allowing multiple races to be selected was a good design choice, because race is somewhat ambiguous and people may identify with one or multiple races. I also believe allowing self-identification was a good choice because I think people can accurately define their own race and aren't incentivised to lie on a census report. The census could be more accurate by allowing people to explain what proportion of each race they identify as, i.e. 25% Asian and 75% Caucasian.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The Census gathered data on sex and gender by using the sex at birth, and didn't ask questions about sexual orientation or current gender. I believe this could be improved by adding questions about sexual orientation, and that would improve the quality of the data by making it more accurate and being able to identify people based on self-identified gender.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. I imagine that many people who identify as LGBT wouldn't answer questions about self-identification, and this would create issues in the data through the presence of missing values. A potential practice would be to look at other studies to estimate the prevalence of LGBT persons and then replace the missing data with those proportions, and a bad practice would be to ignore all of the missing data and only use the collected data.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. One concern I would have is about the ethics of performing analysis on protected characteristics, you would be imputing values and determining a certain number of people are in certain categories when they explicitly didn't answer the question or give consent to their data being collected."
